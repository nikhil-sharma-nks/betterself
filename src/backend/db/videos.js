      'Isn’t it the case we should always stay true to ourselves? Which means that we ought to know who we are, and organize our lives in ways that are compatible with our personalities?\n    When we look for a partner, for example, we look for someone that we’re compatible with, and in regards to education and work, we need to do something that fits our characteristics.\n    However, "not knowing who we are" seems to be a problem. But luckily, this problem can be solved by taking a personality test, by talking to a counselor, or perhaps by going on a long solo-trip around the world to (quote on quote) “find ourselves”.

I was interested in the complete elimination of fear from the mind, and here’s where I’ve arrived.\n    Fear is a barrier that prevents the mind from learning, and the source of fear is our desire to protect ourselves from pain. But we can’t protect ourselves from pain. Our protection lies in the hands of Fate. Fate trades by a contract, and it’s possible to learn this contract and lessen the amount of pain we receive in life. But to completely eliminate fear from the mind, two things have to be true: when Fate does give us pain, it’s necessary and bearable. And only when fear vanishes are we able to be free, uncontrolled by anyone. But as long as fear exists in the mind, there’s always a tyrant trying to control us.',
